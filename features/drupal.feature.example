Feature: Update old issues on drupal

Background:
When I am on "https://drupal.org/user"
And I fill in "Username or email" with "Dries"
And I fill in "Password" with "loveGor"
And I press "Log in"

Scenario Outline: I need to update old issues on drupal.org but they don't have any sort of bulk operations
Then I close all "Drupal" issues with version "<version>" and message:
"""
This issue is being closed because it was filed against a version that is no longer supported.

If the issue still persists in the latest version of Drupal, please open a new issue.
"""
Examples:
| version |
| 8.0.x-dev |
